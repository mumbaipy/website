Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon.

<p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).</p>
<h4 id="7-reporting-guidelines">7. <code>Reporting Guidelines</code></h4>
<p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. mumpy[dot]p[at]gmail.com.</p>
<p>Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.</p>
<h4 id="8-addressing-grievances">8. <code>Addressing Grievances</code></h4>
<p>If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify mumbaipy with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.</p>
<h4 id="9-scope">9. <code>Scope</code></h4>

<p>This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.</p>
